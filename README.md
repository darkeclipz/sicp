# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repository contains code that I wrote while reading the SICP book. Instead of using Scheme, as is used in the book, I wrote the examples with Racket, which is another Lisp styled language.

The book can be found here: https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/.
